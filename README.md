<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

A real estate web app designed to help users buy, rent and sell residential properties. The target users are Homebuyers, Property renters,  system administrator(s), and real-estate brokers. 
<br/> 
<strong>Homebuyers</strong> can search for properties,  filtering properties can be by price range; the number of rooms; living and lot area dimensions; time in the market; building type; year built, etc. They can save properties as favourites (without having to make an account), request visits by messaging the brokers managing the respective property, search for brokers, calculate the mortgage on a given property.<br/>
	<strong>Renters</strong> have the same features without the mortgage calculator.
<br/> <strong>Brokers</strong> can submit offers on behalf of their clients and track the status of the offers. They can request a visit on behalf of their clients, CRUD property listings, use system to match properties with their clients’ needs (e.g. 2 rooms, bungalow, under 500k$ etc.), manage incoming offers for properties they represent, manage booked visits (reschedule/cancel).
	System Admin is responsible for adding/removing brokers (CRUD operations on brokers).

<!-- PROJECT APPROACH -->

## Project Approach

In this section, one can understand our project approach. In other words, why we went with certain technologies and our our design pattern

<strong>Built with</strong>

* We’re going with React JS as a front-end Framework since it is widely used for beginner to professional-level web applications. In fact, millions of libraries are available for React developers to assist them in the development of a project. Also, the development team members' skills revolve around this framework and the Javascript language which would help deliver the best possible quality.
  
* Consequently, Express JS Framework is not only based on the same language as React JS, Javascript, but it is also used worldwide as a good backend solution for web apps, which is what we are trying to accomplish.
  
* MongoDB is a NoSQL based database that is light and agile enough for our development needs.

* Google Maps API provides customizable and interactive maps that can be easily embedded into our web application to improve the user's experience.

<strong>Design pattern</strong>

As a development team following an Agile methodology, we'll be using a Model, View & Controller (MVC) design pattern. This model not only makes it easier on larger development team since it makes it straightforward what attributes are going to be used, but it also is interchangeable when needed, which matches with our retroactive style. Our  main focus is to build a real estate web app that is flawless first and then add features on top of a solid foundation depending on the time frame remaining, this design will help us achieve that.
